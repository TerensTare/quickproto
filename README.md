# Quickproto

This repo contains the source code for a simple toy programming language written in C++23. The goal of this project is to study and understand how Sea of Nodes (SoN) can be used as an alternative to SSA for intermediate representation. Compilation goes through the following steps:

```cpp
Source code > Lexing > (Parsing + SoN generation + peephole/optimizing SoN) > Dead code elimination
```

Here is a list of the passes implemented in the peephole stage so far:
- [x] Constant folding for the following nodes:
    - binary: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
    - unary: `-const(x)` to `const(-x)`

## Building

### ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

- [ ] A C++23 compiler that supports `std::print`.
- [ ] CMake 3.25 or later.
- [ ] [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to manage project dependencies. Make sure to set the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable as described in the official docs.


### ðŸ”¨ Building

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
# This is on Windows, depending on the OS/shell replace %VCPKG_ROOT% with how you access an environment variable
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=%VCPKG_ROOT%/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build .
```
